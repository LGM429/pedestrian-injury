The ones that bucked the trend were midtown Manhattan zip codes that see lots of foot traffic.</h3>

			<p class="intro">
				Different New York City officials have released separate traffic safety plans in late November after several cases of tragic, high-profile deaths of children hit by cars. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Mayor Adams unveiled a plan in direct response to 7-year-old <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/7-year-old-boy-struck-and-killed-by-turning-tow-truck-in-fort-greene-brooklyn/" target="_blank">Kamari Hughes’s</a> death, who was killed by a police tow truck operator in Fort Greene. The night before the mayor’s plan was released, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/nyregion/hit-run-boy-killed-queens.html" target="_blank">Quintus Chen</a>, just a toddler, was struck and killed in a hit and run in Flushing.
			</p>
            <p> 
                “Our streets must be safe places for all New Yorkers — pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists alike,” said Adams, at the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-23/mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of-broad-new" target="_blank">press conferece</a>. The mayor announced a doubling of the current intersection redesign pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mayor’s plan involves daylighting 1,000 intersections — meaning the removal of parking spaces nearest to an intersection to increase visibility for pedestrians and motorists — as well as the inclusion of traffic violence in CompStat, the police crime reporting database, officials said.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The other plan, the <a href="https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2023/11/Western-Queens-Street-Safety-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Western Queens Street Safety Plan</a>, aims to take a neighborhood-wide approach, according to the report. The plan includes universal daylighting, protected bike lanes and creating open streets around schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, where is safest to cross the street in New York City? Where is it most dangerous?

                In the decade since 2013, the neighborhoods that have the highest incidence of pedestrian injuries seem to have been predominantly lower income and often majority Black.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both two zip codes — 11207 and 11212 — with the greatest number of pedestrian injuries have median incomes among the lowest in the city and contain the majority Black neighborhoods of East New York and Brownsville. Historically, these were areas that were <a href="https://rayortigas.github.io/cs171-inequality-in-nyc/" target="_blank">redlined</a> in the 20th century.  
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s not random,” where poor infrastructure design results in more frequent traffic casualties, said Leah Shahum of Vision Zero Network, a street safety advocacy group, in a phone interview. The communities that are the most unsafe “are low-income communities. They’re communities of color.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The only zip codes that have both high median incomes and high numbers of pedestrian injuries are those concentrated in downtown and midtown Manhattan, which are touristic business districts.
